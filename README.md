# Simple GO Authentication Server

## About
This project is mainly for practicing building REST Api's with Go and implementing common functionality that REST Api's have, as well as figuring clean architecture to use for other projects. In future I may add a Next.js frontend to call the routes from.

## Features
* Sign Up
* Sign In
* Refresh Token for Authentication

## Todo
* Adding Postgres
* Reworking JWT authentication
* Caching with Redis
* More interactivity

## Notes
* Currently JWT token acts similar to session except it does not get stored on user and is not compared to.
